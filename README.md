# User Authentication with Social Media Links

## Overview

This project provides a login and signup system with the added feature of allowing users to provide and display their social media links. Built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, the application ensures secure user authentication and seamless integration of user profile information.

## Features

- **Signup and Login**: Users can create an account and log in using their email and password.
- **Social Media Links**: Upon signup, users can provide their social media links (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn) that will be displayed on their profile page.
- **Secure Authentication**: User passwords are hashed for security using bcrypt.
- **Email Verification**: Users need to verify their email address before their account becomes active.
- **Database Storage**: User data, including social media links, is securely stored in a MongoDB database.
- **User Profiles**: After logging in, users can view and update their profile information, including social media links.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side scripting.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for building the API endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data.
- **bcrypt**: Library for hashing passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library for creating JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
- **Nodemailer**: Library for sending email verification links.
